If you, like me, love python and don't want to use php any more and if you don't want to waste time learning a new web framework, then try pywese.
There is a subproject into this one.
I'm develping a blog software using pywese. It was the best way that I find to verify if pywese works well
It's in an early stage of development.... hope to modify this README soon.

(I apologize form something that you already have notice, my poor inglish )
