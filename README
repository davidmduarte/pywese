If you, like me, love python and don't want to use php any more and if you don't want to waste time learning a new web framework, then try pywese.
There is a subproject into this one.
I'm develping a blog software using pywese. It was the best way that I find to verify if pywese works well
It's in an early stage of development.... hope to modify this README soon.
